Prompt: 

  A 45-year-old man, known diabetic, reports increased thirst, 
  frequent urination, and blurred vision. His blood glucose 
  levels are consistently high. 
  
  What adjustments should be considered in his management plan?

```

```

Respone:

The patient's symptoms suggest a worsening of diabetic control. Given the
known risk of hyperglycemia leading to acute kidney injury, we need to
closely monitor and manage blood glucose levels. This may involve
adjusting medication or insulin regimens. We also need to ensure adequate
hydration status by increasing fluid intake and monitoring urine output.
[User should consider consulting a nephrologist.]

This case highlights the importance of close monitoring and management in
patients with known diabetes, particularly those at risk for acute
complications like acute kidney injury. The user should consider
consulting a specialist when necessary to ensure optimal patient care.

## Introduction

It's a chatbot that uses the Llama 2 model to provide medical answers to questions. It is not intended to replace a medical professional, but to provide a starting point for further research.

### Use Case

Consider a time when you had a question, a personal question that you didn't know the answer to. 
Rather than waiting in a doctor's office, you can ask MedChat and get a quick answer.
